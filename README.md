# Mid-Term Project
This repository cointains create a model for predicting 2020 January flight delay based on data from 2018 and 2019

## Hello and Welcome!!!

The goal is to predict arrival delays of commercial flights. Often, there isn't much airlines can do to avoid the delays, therefore, they play an important role in both profits and loss of the airlines. It is critical for airlines to estimate flight delays as accurate as possible because the results can be applied to both, improvements in customer satisfaction and income of airline agencies.

### Files

- **exploratory_analysis.ipynb**: This file contains our initial exploratory data analysis
- **Flight_delay_prediction.ipynb**: this file contains instructions for modeling part of the project. We recommend to split modeling tasks into more notebooks.
- **Flights_test.ipynb**: This file contains the codes we manipulate with the final dataset with our features: weather and information about historical delays
- **final_submission.csv**: this file is the final submission contain our prediction for Jan 2020 flight delay.
